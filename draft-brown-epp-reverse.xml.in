    <t>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) extension mapping for reversing previous EPP commands.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

  <t>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) provides a way for clients to create and update objects in a central repository. Usually, the commands that a client sends to a server will have been initiated upon request of a human being. As a result, occasionally a command is sent which contains an error.</t>
  <t>EPP clients have some options to remedy such mistakes: for example, they can send a &lt;delete&gt; command to delete an object created in error (and may receive a refund if they do so within some grace period), cancel a previous &lt;transfer&gt; request, or send an &lt;update&gt; command to amend the properties of an object.</t>
  <t>However, there are some circumstances where it is not possible to correct an error by using an existing command. For example, clients may inadvertently send multiple &lt;renew&gt; commands (because their implementation queries the server for a domain's expiry date, thereby defeating the idempotency measures built into EPP) or specify an incorrect period (e.g. a two-year renewal which should have only been for one year).</t>
  <t>As another example, a client may perform an &lt;update&gt; command on an object, but keep no record of the previous state of the object, preventing them from correcting the error.</t>
  <t>None of the mistakes in the examples above can be fixed using the existing EPP command repertoire. The extension described in this document attempts to provide an additional remedy for such cases, by providing a way for a client to request that a previous command be reversed. In order to reverse a command, the client need only record the &lt;svTRID&gt; returned by the server in its response to the command.</t>

  <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    <t>XML is case sensitive. Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the character case presented in order to develop a conforming implementation.</t>
    <t>"reverse" is used as an abbreviation for "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:reverse-&VERSION;". The XML namespace prefix "reverse" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and output the XML documents.</t>
    <t>(Note to RFC Editor: remove the following paragraph before publication as an RFC.)</t>
    <t>The XML namespace prefix above contains a version number, specifically "&VERSION;". This version number will increment with successive versions of this document, and will reach 1.0 if and when this document is published as an RFC. This permits clients to distinguish which version of the extension a server has implemented.</t>

<section title="Extension Elements">

  <t>This specification provides a new EPP command, called &lt;reverse&gt;. As the set of EPP command verbs cannot be updated without updating the core EPP specifications, this command is implemented as an extension.</t>

  <t>When a client wants to reverse a previous command, it sends an EPP command frame containing only an &lt;extension&gt; element. The &lt;extension&gt; element contains a &lt;reverse&gt; element, which in turn contains the details of the command the client wishes to reverse. The &lt;reverse&gt; element has the following child elements:</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">
    <t>An OPTIONAL &lt;reason&gt; element which contains a human-readable explanation of why the client is submitting the request. The server MAY require inclusion of a &lt;reason&gt; element depending on its own policy.</t>
    <t>A &lt;trID&gt; element which uniquely identifies the command that the client wishes to reverse. The &lt;trID&gt; element is derived from the element of the same name in <xref target="RFC5730"/>.</t>
    <t>An OPTIONAL &lt;clTRID&gt; element that uniquely identifies this command to the server.</t>
  </list></t>

  <t>Example &lt;reverse&gt; request frame:</t>

<section title="Server Handling of Reverse Commands">
  <t>Which commands a server will accept &lt;reverse&gt; commands for is a matter of server policy (which server operators should provide to client operators). If a server acceps a &lt;reverse&gt; command, it MUST respond with a 1000 or 1001 result code. If the server returns a 1001 response, the client MUST be notified of outcome of the offline process via the EPP message queue. If the server rejects the command, it MUST respond with a 2400 result code.</t>

  <t>Servers MUST NOT perform partial reversals of client commands. If the command cannot be reversed atomically and in full, the server MUST send a 2400 response back to the client.</t>

  <t>If a server cannot perform a reversal of a client command because of a subsequent update, then it MUST send a 2400 response back to the client.</t>

  <t>Servers MUST NOT allow a client to reverse a command that it did not originally submit. Servers SHOULD implement policies that flag &lt;reverse&gt; commands for offline processing where changes might have security implications (such as those which would remove client-assigned status codes, alter authorisation information or add or remove <xref target="RFC5910">secDNS</xref> records, etc).</t>

  <t>Servers MUST reject a command which attempts to reverse a &lt;reverse&gt; command.</t>
</section>

<section title="EPP &lt;poll&gt; command">
  <t>Servers which return 1001 response codes to &lt;reverse&gt; commands MUST notify clients of the outcome of the out-of-band process via the EPP message queue. The format of the &lt;poll&gt; message is as follows.</t>
  <t>The &lt;resData&gt; element of the &lt;poll&gt; response contains a &lt;revData&gt; element which contains a &lt;reTRID&gt; element and a &lt;reDate&gt; element. The &lt;reTRID&gt; element contains an OPTIONAL &lt;clTRID&gt; and a &lt;svTRID&gt; element, which together identify the &lt;reverse&gt; command submitted by the client. The &lt;reTRID&gt; element has a MANDATORY "reResult" element which is a boolean, and which indicates the outcome of the offline review. The &lt;revData&gt; may also contain an OPTIONAL &lt;reDate&gt; element which contains the date and time when the offline review was completed.</t>
  <t>The &lt;msg&gt; element contains a human-readable message describing the outcome of the review.</t>

  <t>Example of a &lt;poll&gt; message:</t>
